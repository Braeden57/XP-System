# XP-System Documentation
Before learning how to use this software. Be sure to set up the site by reading `README.md`.
Once you have completed the setup and are ready to use the software follow theses steps:

1. [Making a site Admin](#Setting-up-site-Admin).
2. [Registering a Teacher](#Register-a-Teacher)

### Register a Teacher
The site needs a Teacher for managing classes/assignments within those classes.
To create a Teacher:

1. Have your site Admin login
2. To the right of the page is the main panel. Click the `Create Teacher` button.

### Setting up site Admin
There is no default site admin so you will need to set one up.
To set up a site Admin:

1. You'll need to create the site admin in the database in a collection called users,
and insert a document via MongoDB Compass. Format the document as shown:
`{
  "role": "Admin",
  "name": your name,
  "email": your email,
  "password": your encrypted password
 }`

2. Replace `your name` with the name you specify, `your email` with the email you would like to use to  login, and replace `your encrypted password` with your [Encrypted Password](#Encrypting-Your-Password)

The ID for your admin document should be auto generated by MongoDB Compass when you `insert` the document.

It's that easy! Now that the site Admin has been created the software is ready to use.

### Encrypting Your Password
1. To encrypt your password while creating the admin account. Go into the `config` folder,
1. follow the instructions in encrypt.js and run encrypt.js via node `node encrypt.js`
